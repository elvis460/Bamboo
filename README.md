# Pre-slae Website

This program is building for pre-saling the products that `NTUST Hsinchu Area Alumni Association` will sell on our anniversary celebrations of our university.

The [production website](https://bamboo.villager.website/) is still working for demo.

It's a pretty simple website with backend system, and anyone who need to do pre-sale like this, welcome to use this for free.
